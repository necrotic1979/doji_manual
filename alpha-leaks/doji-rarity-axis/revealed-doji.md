Note:

* You can see the probabilities screen each time you rename your Doji
* The background type and background color always have the same probabilities, they do not indicate the probability to have either this specific background type or this specific background color, but the probability to have this set of background type and color.
* Same situation for eyes type and color.
* Constellations, visor motif, antenna (top and side), headfones, and camera (head and body) are optional parts which probabilities are not displayed during the reveal. The community is collected information about them.
